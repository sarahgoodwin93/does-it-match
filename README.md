# Design

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen to look like a retro game, bright bold and vibrant colours were chosen for the logo and buttons - {#e7014c}, {#ff9e1d}.
![Hex Colours](assets/images/readme-images/colour-hex.png "#e7014 and #ff9e1 colour hex codes")

A pastel background was chosen to make the main colours pop, {#ffd5e2}
![Hex Colours](assets/images/readme-images/colour-ffd5e2.png "#ffd5e2 colour hex code")

Within the boxes the colours are also pastel to show a stark difference between the main pink - {#e7014c}.
These colours were chosen from [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/pastel-colors/ "link to visme website")
![Pastel Colours](assets/images/readme-images/visme-colours.png "pastel colour hex codes")

## Wire frames

A wireframe was made to flesh out the design and strucutre of the site and visualise user expereince. Wireframe were created using [figma](https://www.figma.com/?fuid= "link to figma homepage")

![WireFrame](assets/images/readme-images/wireframe.png "figma wireframe image")

## Typography

The font [Tektur](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tektur "link to Tektur google font") was used throughout the side to give it a arcade game type feel. It's octagonal outlines and rectangular style fit within the retro design for the game.

Sans-Serif has been applied as a back-up in case of import failure.

# Features

## Navigation

Each page has 2 navigation buttons to take you to the other pages, they are all places towards the bottom of the screen to allow continuity for the user expereince.

If you are on the 'Homepage', you will see the buttons for 'How to Play' and 'Play Game'
If you are on the 'How to Play' page, you will see the buttons for 'Homepage' and 'Play Game'
If you are on the 'Play Game' page, you will see the buttons for 'Homepage' and 'How to Play'

Therefore whichever page button is lacking, shows you which page you are on.

## Hero Image / Logo

The logo of the ColourChange Challenge shows an example of the game while using the sites 2 main colours - {#e7014c}, {#ff9e1d}.

It allows users to know straight away they will be doing a challenge with a grid and colours, and the bright colours draw users in and create an excitement to the page.

Because the logo and the game grid are of similar size it allows for continuity in the user experience, almost like you are playing as soon as you enter the site!

## Home

The homepage is a simple design offering a large logo image of the game grid, an enticing description about the game and two large navigation buttons for the instrctions and the game.

A simple design was chosen so that users have a clear action path, either to read the game instrctuion or to so straight to the game play.
